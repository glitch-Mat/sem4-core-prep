Semester IV Core Subject Preparation

This repository contains dedicated preparation materials, code, and configurations for critical core subjects in my upcoming Semester IV curriculum. The focus is on project-based learning to secure a strong conceptual foundation.

Subjects & Focus Areas

Operating Systems (OS): Notes and simulations related to Process Management, Memory Management, and Concurrency.
Containerization & Virtualization: Practical labs using **Docker** and foundational setup for **Kubernetes**. Contains Dockerfiles and necessary YAML configurations.
Introduction to AI/ML: Foundational scripts for Linear Algebra review and conceptual models (e.g., Gradient Descent implementation).
Fundamentals of IOT: Conceptual designs, protocol comparisons (MQTT vs. HTTP), and theoretical architecture plans.

Status
Currently setting up the environment. Labs will be added weekly.
